>This website is built with three sections.
>On the dashboard page  the client can access all transactions by using a graph, the last 3 transaction histories, the total balance, the total income, the total expense and the 
the minimum and maximum salary.
>On the income section all the incomes are displayed and after the appropriate filling of the data, the user can add an income to the database.
>On the expense section all the expenses are displayed and after the appropriate filling of the data, the user can add an expense to the database.
>Because I made the login and register page functionality, I didn't focus on that on this site.
